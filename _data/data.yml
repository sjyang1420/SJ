career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University, specializing in high-speed electronic and photonic integrated circuit design. 
    My research focuses on integration of electronics and photonics for next-generation interconnects. 
    I have hands-on experience across multiple tape-outs in both electronic and photonic platforms, along with system integration and packaging.
    With a strong foundation in analog/mixed-signal design and a cross-disciplinary perspective, I aim to contribute to innovative architectures that bridge optics and electronics.
    I am a fast learner, self-driven, and comfortable collaborating across domains to solve complex challenges.
